<h1>Writing Guide</h1>
<div class="content">
<p>Below, you can find some tips regarding writing of linguistic papers. You can also find some useful tips regarding credible sources, citation software and glossing rules. There is always an example and there are links to websites which provide bigger insight.</p>

<p><h2>Linguistic Paper Format Guidelines</h2>
    <h3>General suggestions:</h3> Spacing 1 or 1.5, font size 12, alignment justified, use numbered pages 1 standard page = 1800 characters (including spaces)<br>

<strong>Your paper must include:</strong>
First page with the title of your paper/essay, your name, number of characters used (not including the Works Cited), term (e.g.: Summer 2019), name of the course (e.g.: Morphosyntax) and the table Obligatory Basics (scroll down) with checked slots.
Always include an introduction, the main body (can be divided into numbered subsections), conclusions (what you have found out) and works cited. In your Works Cited you can only use the literature that you actually used in your paper that means quoted or specifically referred to, nothing else. Ideally, use MLA or Chicago style. I strongly suggest using Zotero program (see below) that will do this for you and enable you to switch between different styles.<br>
<strong>Example of Works Cited (a book, a chapter and an article in a magazine):</strong>
<ul><li>Croft, W. 1990. <i>Typology and Universals</i>. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</li>
<li>Franks, S., and N. Hornstein. 1992. “Secondary Predication in Russian and Proper Government of PRO.” In <i>Control and Grammar</i>, edited by Richard K. Larson, Sabine Iatridou, Utpal Lahiri, and James Higginbotham, 1-50. Dordrecht: Springer.</li>
<li>Heim, I., H. Lasnik, and R. May. 1991. “Reciprocity and Plurality.” <i>Linguistic Inquiry 22</i> (1): 63-101.</li></ul>

Always order your sources alphabetically. If you have multiple sources from one author, order them according to the year of publication from the oldest to the newest one.<br>

<strong>Quoting:</strong>
If you are referring to some article or book in your text use this: “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit” (Black et al. 2011, 45). 
Or use: Black et al. (2011, 45) claim that “[l]orem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”. If you are changing anything in the direct quote, like the capital letter at the beginning of the sentence, you need to indicate that by
using square brackets.
When you quote other authors, it should not exceed 15% of your text and you should always clearly indicate which ideas are your own and which are taken from other sources (quotes shorter than 4 lines are in quotation marks, longer quotes are put into block format without quotation marks, indented, spacing 1 and the font size is 10. E.g.:

<div class="longquote">
Not only do languages influence what we remember, but the structures of languages can make it easier or harder for us to learn new things. For instance, because the number words in some
languages reveal the underlying base-10 structure more transparently than do the number words in English (there are no troublesome teens like 11 or 13 in Mandarin, for instance), kids
learning those languages are able to learn the base-10 insight sooner. And depending on how many syllables the number words have, it will be easier or harder to keep a phone number in
mind or to do mental calculation. (Boroditsky 2011, 65)</div>


<strong>Paraphrasing:</strong>
Paraphrases are sentences or phrases that convey the same meaning using different wording. This is an example of a paraphrase of the long quote above:
According to Boroditsky (2001), our ability to use numbers and do number operations depends on the kind of language we use and on how complex and systematic the number words in the
particular language are.

<strong>Examples and Glossing:</strong>
If you use examples, number them from 1 onwards (do not start from 1 again in the next subsection). This will enable you to refer back to your examples in the text (use “cross reference”
for that in your MS Word document – “křížový odkaz” in Czech).
If you use examples from other languages than English (1), use glosses for those features that are important for your claims. If no features are important, use just word-for-word explanation.
For example, if you want to show that in Czech, modal verbs can show past tense, indicate that.
The second line of the example is a word for word translation, plus an explanation of the crucial features through indices. To ensure a word-for-word gloss, you can use a table (invisible when
printed). The third line is a translation into good English.<br>

1. <i>Petr musel pracovat celý den.</i><br>
Petr3SG must3SG.PAST workINF all day<br>
‘Peter had to work all day.’<br>

You can find the glossing rules <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php">here</a>.</p>

<strong>Data:</strong> Language data must be differentiated from the text with italics (see the example above).
Examples in text can be done like this: “In the Czech phrase <i>černou kávu</i> ‘black coffee’, the final
<i>-ou</i> of the adjective is an accusative marker, but the English <i>black coffee</i> has no such case ending.”
For the example (linguistic data) we used italics and for the translation into the language of the paper we used single quotation marks.<br>

<strong>Emphasis:</strong>
Important ideas/features can be stressed with bold or underlined fonts. Do not use italics for this purpose. It would be confusing as italics are reserved for the language data in general. Finally, always use spellcheck.<br>

<p><h3>Citation software ZOTERO</h3>
Using a citation software will make your life easier. I espcially recommend Zotero available for free at <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">zotero.org</a>. 
You need to enable it in your Microsoft Word and add all the bibliography you are using. The software will generate the citations and bibliography automatically for you. 
You will never omit a single reference ever agian. If you need help with downloading and installing the software, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG7Uq_JFDzE">this video</a>.</p>

<h3>Credible sources</h3>
<p>Always make sure that your sources are credible, i.e. published. When in doubt, do not use the source. In general, if you know the author, it makes the source more credible. </p>

<p> You can use digital libraries, such as <a href="https://www.jstor.org/">jstor.org</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/digital-libraries">sciencedirect.com</a> and you can also go to Web of Science website which is "a paid-access platform that provides access to multiple databases that provide reference and citation data from academic journals, conference proceedings, and other documents in various academic disciplines." 
You can visit the Web of Science <a href="https://www.webofknowledge.com">here</a>.</p>
