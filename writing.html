<h1>Writing Guide</h1>

<p>Below, you can find some tips regarding writing of linguistic papers. You can also find some useful tips regarding credible sources, citation software and glossing rules. There is always an example and there are links to websites which provide bigger insight.</p>

<p>Linguistic Paper Format Guidelines
General suggestions: spacing 1 or 1.5, font size 12, alignment justified, use numbered pages
1 standard page = 1800 characters (including spaces)
Your paper must include:
First page with the title of your paper/essay, your name, number of characters used (not including the Works Cited), term (e.g.: Summer 2019), name of the course (e.g.: Morphosyntax) and the table Obligatory Basics (scroll down) with checked slots.
Always include an introduction, the main body (can be divided into numbered subsections), conclusions (what you have found out) and works cited. In your Works Cited you can only use the literature that you actually used in your paper that means quoted or specifically referred to, nothing else. Ideally, use MLA or Chicago style. I strongly suggest using Zotero program (free to download) that will do this for you and enable you to switch between different styles.
Example of Works Cited (a book, a chapter and an article in a magazine):
 Croft, W. 1990. Typology and Universals. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
Franks, S., and N. Hornstein
Control and Grammar, edited by Richard K. Larson, Sabine Iatridou, Utpal Lahiri, and James Higginbotham, 1 50. Dordrecht: Springer.
Linguistic Inquiry 22 (1): 63101.
Always order your sources alphabetically. If you have multiple sources from one author order them
according to the year of publication from the oldest to the newest one.
Quoting:
If you are referring
Or use: Black et al. (2011, 45) claim that If you are changing anything in the direct quote, like the capital letter at the beginning of the sentence, you need to indicate that by using square brackets.
When you quote other authors, it should not exceed 15% of your text and you should always clearly indicate which ideas are your own and which are taken from other sources (quotes shorter than 4 lines are in quotation marks, longer quotes are put into block format without quotation marks, indented, spacing 1 and the font size is 10. E.g.: 
 Not only do languages influence what we remember, but the structures of languages can make it easier or harder for us to learn new things. For instance, because the number words in some
languages reveal the underlying base-10 structure more transparently than do the number words in English (there are no troublesome teens like 11 or 13 in Mandarin, for instance), kids
learning those languages are able to learn the base-10 insight sooner. And depending on how many syllables the number words have, it will be easier or harder to keep a phone number in
mind or to do mental calculation. (Boroditsky 2011, 65)</p>


<p>Citation software ZOTERO
Using a citation software will make your life easier. I espcially recommend Zotero available for free at zotero.org. 
You need to enable it in your Microsoft Word and add all the bibliography you are using. The software will generate the citations and bibliography automatically for you. 
You will never omit a single reference ever agian. If you need help with downloading and installing the software, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG7Uq_JFDzE.</p>


<p>Credible sources
Always make sure that your sources are credible, i.e. published.</p>

<p>Glossing Rules
Rule 1: Word-by-word alignment
Interlinear glosses are left-aligned vertically, word by word, with the example. E.g.

(1) Indonesian (Sneddon 1996:237)

Merekadi Jakarta sekarang.
 They in Jakarta now
'They are in Jakarta now.
