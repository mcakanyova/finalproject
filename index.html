<p></p>On this introductory site, you will find some useful links regarding the general linguistic topics and also websites that can help your academic career.
    The first link is to an encyclopedia of linguistic terms in Czech, focused on generative grammar framework. It is a project by developed by linguists from Masaryk University in Brno. There are also many tips for further reading.

<p>One of the most important websites for any linguist is the <a href="https://linguistlist.org/events">linguistlist.org</a>. Here, you can find current conference calls, summer schools and you can browse job opportunities worldwide.</p>

<p>If you are interested in cross-linguistic comparison, I recommend visiting The World Atlas of Language Structures <a href="https://wals.info/">wals.info</a>. It is a database of (phonological, grammatical and lexical) features and properties of typologically distinct languages. The contributors are linguists from all over the world and they use some 2662 languages, which is pretty impressive.</p>
