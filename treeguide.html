<p>Working with items such as morphemes and phrases sometimes requires segmentation and combination of the items into bigger structures. This can be best observed in syntactic trees. There are many ways to approach this. Apart from a pen and paper, and Word document lines, there are many programs avaialbel online that will generate the trees for us. Below, you can see some examples as well as some links to online tree builders.</p>



<p>If you want to draw trees through a programme, an ideal one  is this: <a href="https://yohasebe.com/rsyntaxtree/">yohasebe.com/rsyntaxtree/</a>
You need to know how to present the phrases in brackets. Each phrase needs to be broken down to the smallest elements - heads. For example, we can have a sentence: <i>My younger brother reads books</i>.<br>
To segment this sentence, we need to identify the subject DP (<i>my younger brother</i>) and the predicate IP (<i>reads books</i>) and continue with further segmentation. We end up with the follwoing structure:<br>
[CP [DP [D My] [NP [AP younger] [NP brother]]] [IP [I s][VP [V read] [NP [NP books ]]]]]<br>
When we insert the bracketed structure to the websites generator, we get this lovely tree: </p>

<a data-fslightbox="Lectureslides" href="/images/Tree1.png"> <img class="Tree1" src="/images/Tree1_mini.png" alt="My younger brother reads books."> </a><br>


<p>For more practice, we can have a look at the following trees which represent sentences:<br> 
    <ol>
        <li><i>My going to Edinburgh is important.</i></li>
        <li><i>Peter wants him to call me.</i></li>
        <li><i>She decided yeasterday to do it tomorrow.</i></li>
        <li><i>I saw him corss the street.</i></li></ol></p>
