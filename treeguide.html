<p>Working with items such as morphemes and phrases sometimes requires segmentation and combination of the items into bigger structures. This can be best observed in trees. Below, you can see some examples as well as some links to online tree builders.</p>



If you want to draw trees through a programme, an ideal one  is this: <a href="https://yohasebe.com/rsyntaxtree/">yohasebe.com/rsyntaxtree/</a>
You need to know how to present the phrases in brackets. Each phrase needs to be broken down to the smallest elements - heads:<br>
[CP [DP [D My] [NP [AP younger] [NP brother]]] [IP [I s][VP [V read] [NP [NP books ]]]]]<br>

<a data-fslightbox="Lectureslides" href="/images/Tree1.png"> <img class="Tree1" src="/images/Tree1_mini.png" alt="My younger brother reads books."> </a><br>


<p>For more practice, we can have a look at the following trees which represent sentences:<br> 
    <ol>
        <li>My going to Edinburgh is important.</li>
        <li>Peter wants him to call me.</li>
        <li>She decided yeasterday to do it tomorrow.</li>
        <li>I must speak to him.</li></ol></p>
